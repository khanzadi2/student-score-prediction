# 🎯 Student Score Prediction

This project uses a linear regression model to predict students' exam scores based on the number of study hours. It is part of a machine learning internship assignment.

## 📊 Problem Statement
Predict a student's exam score using their study hours using linear regression.

## 📁 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle - Student Performance Factors](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- Features: `study_hours`, `exam_score`, etc.

## 🚀 Workflow
1. Data cleaning and visualization
2. Data splitting (train/test)
3. Linear Regression model training
4. Prediction and evaluation
5. Visualization of regression line

## 🧪 Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R² Score

## 🌟 Bonus
- Polynomial Regression
- Feature expansion (e.g., participation, sleep hours)

## 📚 Libraries Used
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
